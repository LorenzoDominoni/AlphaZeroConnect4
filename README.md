# AlphaZeroConnect4

This repository contains an implementation from scratch of an engine inspired by AlphaZero that plays connect 4 at superhuman level. It is built upon a repository of Robert Foerster, providing some extensions both in the algorithm and the interface. 

It consists in:
- The definition of the games
- The definition of the deep learning models
- The definition of the MCTS
- The definition of the main AlphaZero algorithm
- The training of the algorithm
- The games against itself
- The games against the user

It could easily be extended to play further 2 people perfect information games by just coding them with states, actions and playes
